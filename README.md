# Transcriptomic Analysis in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients

## Description

This repository contains the Masterâ€™s Thesis of **Israel David Duarte Herrera**, submitted for the Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and Universitat de Barcelona, 2022).

The project focuses on the transcriptomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, applying a complete bioinformatics pipeline to identify gene expression profiles associated with different clinical severity levels (severe vs. critical patients).

The work included:  
- Preprocessing and quality control of RNA-seq data (FASTQ files)  
- Transcript quantification with **Salmon**  
- Differential expression analysis using **DESeq2**  
- Results visualization (volcano plots, heatmaps, clustering, etc)  
- Biological interpretation and identification of potential biomarkers

Among the findings, over 2,000 differentially expressed genes were identified, highlighting candidates such as **PGLYRP1**, **HDAC9**, and **FUT4**.
